# FedRAMP Requests For Comment (RFCs)

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) intends to
engage continuously and iteratively with our stakeholders. This repository will
serve as an ongoing digital meeting place for us to hear your experiences and
perspectives.

All FedRAMP Requests For Comments (RFCs) are open to responses from the public
and government, including representatives from cloud service providers,
third-party independent assessment organizations, federal agencies, industry
organizations, or individuals interested in cybersecurity and cloud services.

All RFCs will provide alternate comment submission methods for people unfamiliar
with GitHub or who prefer to submit comments differently.

### **How will FedRAMP request comments?**

FedRAMP will create a fork of this repo to initiate an RFC on specific topics.
All discussion and participation will occur in the fork, and the outcome will be
merged into this repo when the RFC is closed.

The forked repo will have [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)
enabled and stakeholders are encouraged to create new discussions with your
feedback and interact with feedback provided by others. The FedRAMP team may
seek clarification or participate in the discussion as appropriate, and may
close discussions that have run their course after review.

FedRAMP will communicate with the public about open RFCs via its various social
channels, including blogs, email lists, and more. The team may run multiple RFCs
simultaneously, and the
[status of all RFCs can be seen here](README.md).

#### **Providing feedback**

There are multiple ways to provide feedback on a full RFC:

- Participate in the Discussion

- Suggest changes to a document by opening a pull request (you will need to fork
  this repo first). The pull request must suggest one or more changes and
  describe the rationale for the change(s).

- Follow the instructions in the RFC to use alternative mechanisms for public
  feedback, such as online forms or email.

It is important that each piece of feedback is _concise_ and _actionable_,
providing enough information for the document maintainers to address the comment
adequately.

**Please follow our [Code of Conduct](../main?tab=coc-ov-file#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) at all
times\!**

#### **How FedRAMP will participate**

This engagement process is a feedback cycle that drives changes and further
discussion. During the public comment period, the following will occur as a
cycle:

1. **Feedback and Discussion**

   - Engagement between FedRAMP authors and commenters, with responses to
     feedback.

2. **Continuous Revision**

   - FedRAMP authors will review and decide to accept or reject the feedback,
     making appropriate edits.

The end of the public comment period **does not mean FedRAMP will immediately
implement the policy.** Other governance activities and final approval will be
required. When ready for adoption or publication, final policies or documents
will be widely shared publicly, with appropriate implementation activities.

_Currently, only members of the FedRAMP team can initiate the formal RFC
process._

### **Why should I submit RFC feedback?**

FedRAMP stakeholders, including cloud service providers (CSPs), security
professionals, government agencies, and industry experts, may provide public
feedback on these documents for several key reasons:

- Influencing Policy and Framework Development: FedRAMP documents, such as
  updates to security guidelines, assessment frameworks, or requirements,
  directly impact stakeholders. By providing feedback, stakeholders have an
  opportunity to shape the policies to ensure they are practical, effective, and
  aligned with industry standards. This can help ensure that the requirements
  and guidelines are feasible for implementation and improve overall security.

- Addressing Practical Implementation Challenges: Stakeholders who are directly
  involved in the FedRAMP authorization or in the process of securing federal
  use may experience unanticipated practical challenges. Public feedback allows
  these stakeholders to highlight real-world issues, propose solutions, and
  ensure that policies are aligned with technological trends and operational
  realities.

- Advocating for Cost-Effectiveness and Efficiency: Cloud service providers and
  other affected parties are often concerned about the costs and administrative
  burden associated with meeting FedRAMP requirements. Providing feedback allows
  stakeholders to advocate for streamlined processes, suggest more efficient
  frameworks, or raise concerns about requirements that might be too expensive
  or complex.

- Ensuring Transparency and Accountability: Public feedback fosters an open
  dialogue between the government and industry. It promotes transparency and
  ensures that stakeholders are part of the decision-making process. This
  collaboration helps build trust between federal agencies and private sector
  participants and ensures that the government remains accountable for
  considering diverse perspectives.

- Mitigating Security Risks: Security professionals may provide feedback to
  ensure that FedRAMP security guidelines are rigorous enough to mitigate
  evolving cybersecurity threats. Their insights help ensure the government's
  security posture remains up-to-date and effectively protects sensitive data.

- Encouraging Innovation: By participating in the public feedback process,
  stakeholders can propose innovative approaches, highlight emerging
  technologies, and suggest ways to incorporate these into the FedRAMP program.
  This ensures that the program remains adaptive to the fast-paced evolution of
  cloud technologies.

Ultimately, public feedback helps ensure that FedRAMP documents and policies
reflect the needs and expertise of both government and private sector entities,
fostering a more secure, efficient, and collaborative cloud security
environment.
